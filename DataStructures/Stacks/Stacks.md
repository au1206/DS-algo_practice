#Stacks

Stacks and Queues are dynamic sets in which the element removed from the set by the DELETE 
Operation is pre-specified.

In a STACK, the element deleted from the set is the one most recently inserted: the stack implements a
**Last- in, First-out or LIFO**.


INSERT operation ---> PUSH - O(1)

DELETE operation ---> POP - O(1)
